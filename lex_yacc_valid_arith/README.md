## LEX

This is a simple Lex code (also known as a lexer or lexical analyzer) that tokenizes input for a calculator-like language. Let's go through the code line by line:

```lex
%{
#include "program.tab.h"
int yyerror();
%}
```

- `%{` and `%}` are used to include C code within the Lex file. In this case, it includes the header file `"program.tab.h"` and declares a function `yyerror()`.

```lex
%%
[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?    { return NUM; }
```

- This line specifies a rule for matching numeric constants, possibly with a decimal point. When a match is found, it returns the token `NUM`, which is likely defined in the included header file.

```lex
[a-zA-Z_][_a-zA-Z0-9]* { return ID; }
```

- This line defines a rule for matching identifiers. Identifiers must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, underscores, or digits. When a match is found, it returns the token `ID`.

```lex
[-+*/()]             { return yytext[0]; }
```

- This line defines rules for matching individual arithmetic operators and parentheses. When a match is found, it returns the matched character as the token.

```lex
\n                   { return 0; }
```

- This line matches newline characters. When a newline is encountered, it returns 0, indicating the end of input.

```lex
.                    { yyerror(); }
```

- This line matches any character that hasn't matched any of the previous rules. It calls the `yyerror()` function, which likely handles errors in the input.

```lex
%%
```

- This marks the end of the rules section.

```lex
int yywrap()
{
    return 1;
}
```

- This is a user-defined function `yywrap()`. It is called when the lexer reaches the end of the input. The function returns 1, indicating that there is no more input.

In summary, this Lex code defines rules for tokenizing numeric constants, identifiers, arithmetic operators, parentheses, and newline characters. If it encounters any other characters, it calls `yyerror()`. The lexer returns tokens corresponding to the matched patterns, and when it reaches the end of the input, it calls `yywrap()`.

## YACC

This is a Yacc (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) code, also known as a parser, for a simple calculator-like language. It defines the grammar for parsing expressions. Let's go through the code line by line:

```yacc
%{
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
int yyerror();
int yylex();
%}
```

- `%{` and `%}` are used to include C code within the Yacc file. In this case, it includes standard C libraries and declares the `yyerror()` and `yylex()` functions.

```yacc
%token NUM ID
%left '+' '-'
%left '*' '/'
```

- These lines define token names and operator precedence. `%token` declares tokens, and `%left` declares left-associative operators with their precedence.

```yacc
%%
e: e '+' e | e '-' e | e '*' e | e '/' e | '('e')' | NUM | ID ;
```

- This section defines the grammar rules for expressions. The grammar is recursive, allowing for the parsing of complex expressions. The `e` represents an expression, and the rules specify how expressions can be formed using operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), parentheses, numeric constants (`NUM`), and identifiers (`ID`).

```yacc
%%
```

- This marks the end of the grammar rules section.

```yacc
int main(){
    printf("Type the expression and press the enter key     \n");
    yyparse();
    printf("Valid Expression\n");
    return 0;
}
```

- The `main()` function initializes the parsing process by calling `yyparse()`. It prompts the user to enter an expression and prints "Valid Expression" if the parsing is successful.

```yacc
int yyerror(){
    printf("Invalid Expression!\n") ;
    exit(0);
}
```

- The `yyerror()` function is called when an error is encountered during parsing. It prints an error message and exits the program.

In summary, this Yacc code defines a grammar for a simple calculator language with basic arithmetic operations, parentheses, numeric constants, and identifiers. The `main()` function initializes the parsing process, and the `yyerror()` function handles parsing errors. The grammar rules specify how expressions can be formed using different operators and operands.
